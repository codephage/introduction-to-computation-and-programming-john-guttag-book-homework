# introduction-to-computation-and-programming-john-guttag-book-homework
this repo is for sharing the code i have done until now to solve the John Guttag's book programming excercises at end of each chapter.
Please feel free to comment and make your suggestions.
I will be uploading more code as soon as i finish each programming assignment.
